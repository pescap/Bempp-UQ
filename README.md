# Bempp-UQ
A Python/Bempp-based plug-in for uncertainty quantification by random domains. 
Includes:
- (FOA) Tutorials to evaluate the shape derivative for both sound-soft and sound-hard Helmholtz scattering problems
- (TP Main) Tutorial to solve the Transmission Problem (TP) and analyze the convergence of GMRES
- (Combination Technique) Implementation of the CT for the TP by the unit sphere (work in progress to adapt the structure to the docker version of bempp)
- (Tensor Operator Solver) Solve preconditioned tensor operator equations with GMRES
- projection.py Routines to evaluate the transfer operators between grids for P1 elements
- login.py Minor modifications of the original Bempp code
